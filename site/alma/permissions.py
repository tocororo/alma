    Custom permission policy for communities.

    This class overrides the default `CommunityPermissionPolicy` to provide
    a tailored permission model for community-related actions.

    This policy demonstrates how to grant specific permissions for community creation actions:

    - Community creation (`can_create`) is allowed for:
        - Users with the custom 'community-creator' role
        - Users with administration role
        - System processes

    - Direct inclusion of records (`can_include_directly`) is allowed for:
        - Users with administration role
        - System processes
